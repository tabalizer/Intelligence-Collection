# Facebook OSINT Cheat Sheet
_Last verified: 2025-08-10 • Scope: open-source collection only. Use ethically and comply with local law, privacy regulations, and Facebook’s ToS._

---

## 🎯 1) Purpose
A practical guide for collecting and analysing publicly available data from Facebook for investigations, research, and situational awareness.

---

## 🛠 2) Core Collection Methods

### Facebook Native Search & Filters
- Search by **name, keyword, phone number, or email** (if public).
- Use filters for **People, Pages, Groups, Events, Posts**.
- Filter by **location**, **date posted**, and **content type** (photo, video, link).

### Profile & Page Review
- **About Section**: Bio, work/education, contact info, location, websites.
- **Timeline**: Public posts, check-ins, likes, shares, comments.
- **Photos/Videos**: Uploaded or tagged media — check for location clues and EXIF metadata.
- **Friends/Followers**: Public connections; note mutual friends and overlapping networks.

### Groups & Events
- Join open groups to view posts, member lists, and shared media.
- Monitor event pages for participant lists, photos, and organiser info.
- Search for past events for timeline building.

---

## 🔍 3) Key OSINT Targets
- **User ID / Vanity URL** — Can be used to pull archives or cached content.
- **Profile & Cover Photos** — Reverse image search for cross-platform matches.
- **Check-ins** — Locations and travel patterns.
- **Shared Links** — External domains for further investigation.
- **Comments & Reactions** — Identify associates and engagement patterns.
- **Hashtags** — Trace communities, events, and related content.

---

## 🧩 4) Pivoting Opportunities
- Use **reverse image search** (Google, Bing, Yandex) on profile/cover photos.
- Extract domains from shared links and run WHOIS/DNS lookups.
- Cross-reference usernames, names, and emails with other social platforms.
- Follow hashtags across platforms to find parallel content.

---

## 📌 5) Preservation & Archiving
- **Screenshots**: Include URL bar and timestamp.
- **Web Archives**: Use Wayback Machine and Archive.today for posts/profiles.
- **Media Hashes**: Compute SHA-256 for downloaded photos/videos.
- **JSON Exports**: From Facebook’s data download tool (if account owner consent is given).

---

## ⚠️ 6) 2025 Limitations & Considerations
- Facebook’s search capabilities have been reduced — third-party tools may help, but respect ToS.
- Privacy settings and deletion can make content volatile — archive early.
- Avoid methods that bypass security or access controls.

---

## 🛡 7) Investigator Tips
- Always verify the account authenticity — look for creation date, posting history, and network ties.
- Use **aliases** and separate browser profiles to avoid bias in personalised search results.
- Correlate Facebook data with other open sources for stronger conclusions.

---

## 🗂 8) Documentation Hygiene
- Record: Profile URL, username, date of capture, tools used, and archive locations.
- Maintain clear linkage between raw evidence (screenshots, downloads) and your analysis.

---

### 📜 Changelog (2025-08-10)
