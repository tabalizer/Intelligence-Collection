## 🎯 1) Purpose
Geolocation is the art and science of identifying the exact location where a photo, video, or other media was taken, using open-source intelligence (OSINT) methods.  
This sheet delivers a **battle-tested, investigator-grade** methodology combining tools, workflows, and fieldcraft to pinpoint locations with **speed, precision, and high confidence**.

---

## 🛰 2) Core Geolocation Workflow (The 4C Method)
1. **Collect** — Gather all available imagery, metadata, and related contextual info.  
2. **Clues** — Identify every visible marker: terrain, structures, signage, vehicles, vegetation, shadows, weather.  
3. **Corroborate** — Cross-check findings with multiple map sources, timelines, and public data.  
4. **Capture** — Document results with annotated evidence, coordinates, and confidence levels.

## 🔍 3) Key OSINT Tools & Platforms

### Mapping & Imagery
- **Google Earth Pro / Google Maps** — Satellite, Street View, Historical Imagery slider.  
- **Bing Maps** — Alternative angles, Bird’s Eye View in select cities.  
- **Yandex Maps** — High-res imagery in many Eurasian locations.  
- **Mapillary** — Crowdsourced street-level photos, often fresher than Street View.  
- **OpenStreetMap (OSM)** — Editable, metadata-rich maps.  
- **Wikimapia** — User-tagged landmarks with descriptions.  
- **Sentinel Hub EO Browser** — Satellite imagery by date, spectral analysis.  
- **Zoom Earth** — Real-time weather & satellite imagery.  
- **Planet Labs (freemium)** — High-frequency satellite passes for time-sensitive verification.

### Reverse Image & Visual Search
- **Google Lens** — Landmark recognition & visual matching.  
- **Yandex Images** — Exceptional non-Latin and scenery matching.  
- **Bing Visual Search** — Alternate dataset & match logic.  
- **TinEye** — Historical reverse image search to detect earliest appearance.

## 🕵️‍♂️ 4) Visual Clue Categories (The OSINT Investigator’s Checklist)
- **Language & Script** — Street signs, shop names, advertisements, license plates.  
- **Architecture** — Building shapes, roofing materials, window styles.  
- **Natural Features** — Mountains, coastline, vegetation type, snow lines.  
- **Infrastructure** — Road markings, guardrails, lamp posts, bus stops, traffic lights.  
- **Vehicles** — License plate format, vehicle models common to regions.  
- **Climate Indicators** — Clothing worn, vegetation health, seasonal elements.  
- **Shadows & Light** — Use SunCalc.org to determine possible date/time.  
- **Unique Objects** — Statues, billboards, public art, graffiti.

## 🗺 5) Reverse Image Search Strategy
1. Run **full image** through Google Lens/Yandex Images.  
2. Crop to **distinctive areas** (e.g., building roofline, unique sign) for separate searches.  
3. Compare returned images for consistent locations.  
4. Investigate **EXIF metadata** (if available) for GPS coordinates (often stripped by social platforms).

---

## 🌐 6) Cross-Platform Pivoting
- Search hashtags & location tags on Instagram, TikTok, X (Twitter) for matching visuals.  
- Monitor local news archives for event coverage matching background details.  
- Explore Reddit city-specific threads (e.g., r/London, r/Dubai) for location-guessing discussions.

---

## 📍 7) Stabilizing & Documenting Coordinates
- Record **decimal coordinates** to 5+ decimal places (~1 meter precision).  
- Always log **source platform, imagery date**, and **time zone** used.  
- Annotate images with arrows, circles, and labels to highlight key visual matches.

---

## ⚠️ 8) 2025 Environment & Cautions
- Increasing use of **blurred zones** on Google Street View in sensitive areas.  
- Some mapping services remove imagery in conflict zones—archive early.  
- Seasonal changes may alter landscapes—use historical imagery to match conditions.  
- Many regions now have **privacy-first** map policies—cross-check multiple sources.

---

## 🛡 9) Rate Limits, Gating & Investigator Tips
- Rotate between platforms to avoid IP-based rate limiting.  
- Always **verify at least twice** with different map providers before publishing coordinates.  
- Maintain an **offline reference library** of annotated map captures for high-risk or fast-disappearing content.

---

## 🗂 10) Documentation Hygiene
- **Minimum evidence package**:  
  - Original media (or highest-quality copy)  
  - Annotated comparison image (source vs. map)  
  - Coordinates in decimal and DMS format  
  - Platform/tool names and imagery dates  
  - Confidence score (High/Med/Low)  
- Store all findings in a structured repository for future cross-referencing.
