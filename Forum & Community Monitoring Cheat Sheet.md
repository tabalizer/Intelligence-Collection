- Cytoscape

---

### 6️⃣ Cross-Platform Correlation  
🔗 *What to do:*  
- Match aliases, writing style, image EXIF, profile pics.  
- Detect multi-platform personas.

🛠️ *Tools:*  
- Sherlock  
- Maigret  
- EXIFTool  
- Writing style analyzers

---

### 7️⃣ Automation & Scraping  
🤖 *What to do:*  
- Automatically collect data at scale.  
- Set up scheduled pulls or real-time watchers.

🛠️ *Tools:*  
- Python (BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, Selenium)  
- Puppeteer  
- RSS Feed Parsers  
- Browser automation (Playwright)

---

### 8️⃣ Time-Based Monitoring  
⏰ *What to do:*  
- Track activity spikes or lulls.  
- Identify coordinated actions, events, disinfo waves.

🛠️ *Tools:*  
- Timeseries analysis (Pandas, Grafana)  
- Heatmaps  
- Alert systems

## 🧠 Pro Tips

- 🔐 Always use OPSEC: VPN, isolated environments, burner accounts.
- 📁 Log everything. Time-stamp, back up, and structure your findings.
- ⚖️ Know your laws. Respect platform ToS and legal boundaries.
- 📚 Cross-reference findings: one source ≠ truth.
