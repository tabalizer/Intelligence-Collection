## üß≠ Methodology & Techniques

### 1. **Name-Based Searches**
- Use multiple variations: full name, nicknames, maiden names.
- Apply quotation marks in search engines: `"First Last"` + city/state.
- Use tools like Google, Yandex, and DuckDuckGo for different index scopes.

### 2. **Email Address Lookup**
- Search past breaches using tools like:
  - **HaveIBeenPwned**, **Dehashed** (login required), **BreachDirectory**
- Pivot from email to social media with hunter.io or public email lookups.

### 3. **Phone Number Tracing**
- Use reverse lookup platforms:
  - Whitepages, NumLookup, TrueCaller
- Pivot phone numbers into messaging platforms (Telegram, WhatsApp).

### 4. **Social Media Profiling**
- Start with known usernames and handle pivoting (Sherlock, WhatsMyName).
- Analyze linked accounts, follower/following graphs, and bio patterns.
- Use Google and site-specific operators:
  - `site:facebook.com "John Doe"` or `inurl:"/john.doe"`

### 5. **Public Records Examination**
- Search property records, court documents, marriage licenses, or voter rolls (region dependent).
- In the U.S., use state/local .gov portals, or FOIA requests.
- Use FamilyTreeNow for connections between relatives and addresses.
