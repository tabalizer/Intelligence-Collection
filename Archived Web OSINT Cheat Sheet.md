## üß≠ Methodology & Techniques

### 1. **Find Archived Versions**
- Use `Wayback Machine` or `archive.today` with full URLs:
  - Example: `https://archive.org/web/*/example.com/article.html`
  - OR: Paste URL into archive.today to manually trigger capture.

### 2. **Compare Versions Over Time**
- Investigate content changes (text, links, media):
  - Use Wayback's diff tools or download two versions and run `diff` locally.
- Useful for:
  - Tracking evolving narratives
  - Identifying deleted or reworded claims
  - Disinformation mapping

### 3. **Uncover Deleted Pages**
- Use search engine operators to retrieve cached pages:
  - `cache:example.com/page.html`
  - Or use CachedView to view Google/Yandex/Bing stored versions
- If missing: plug URL into Memento Time Travel for alt archives

### 4. **Pre-emptive Archiving (Defensive OSINT)**
- Proactively archive sensitive content (e.g., tweets, blog posts, defaced websites)
- Tools:
  - `SingleFile` (browser extension) for offline .html saving
  - `archive.today` for permanent public archiving

### 5. **Capture Evidence With Metadata**
- Use `Wayback Machine` HTTP headers or JSON API:
  - Shows timestamp, server headers, and crawl info
- Archive pages while logged out to avoid session-specific content

### 6. **Discover Unlinked or Obscure Content**
- Use `Common Crawl` or scrape archived sitemaps for:
  - Deindexed content
  - Shadow domains/subdomains that were once live

## üß© Advanced Tactics

- **Pivot on URLs**: Use archived outbound links to discover associated infrastructure (domains, platforms, etc.).
- **Regex on HTML Snapshots**: Extract emails, API endpoints, or JavaScript artifacts from archived raw source.
- **Capture Before It‚Äôs Deleted**: Use scripts (e.g., `waybackpy`, `screenshotapi.net`) to auto-archive pages on load or via alerts.
- **Investigate Redirect Chains**: Archived versions sometimes show redirect destinations that are now obfuscated live.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Ethical & Operational Notes

- ‚úÖ Archiving public data is generally legal ‚Äî but always verify local laws.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Never archive login sessions or personal inboxes (privacy violation).
- ‚ùå Avoid capturing behind-paywall content if it violates copyright.
