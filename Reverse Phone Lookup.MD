4. **Corroborate** — Match any names, photos, or addresses with independent sources.  
5. **Capture** — Save URLs, screenshots, and notes.

## 🧩 4) Pivoting Opportunities
- Search the number in Google/Bing/Yandex with quotes: `"+15551234567"`.  
- Check marketplace listings, resumes, or forum posts using the number.  
- Reverse image search any profile photos found linked to the number.

## 📌 5) Key Clues from Phone Data
- **Name** — Often from caller ID apps or linked accounts.  
- **Location** — Area code, exchange prefix (but beware of mobile portability).  
- **Service Type** — Mobile, VoIP, landline.  
- **Carrier** — Sometimes reveals business or organization usage.  
- **Linked Accounts** — Social profiles, marketplaces, messaging apps.

---

## 🌐 6) Cross-Platform Verification
- Match names & addresses from multiple directories.  
- Compare photos from messaging apps to social media profiles.  
- Verify business numbers via official company websites.

## ⚠️ 7) 2025 Environment & Cautions
- Many caller ID services now require mobile app installation.  
- VoIP services can easily spoof caller IDs — treat initial matches cautiously.  
- Privacy laws in some regions restrict reverse lookup availability.

---

## 🛡 8) Investigator Tips
- Always confirm matches via at least two unrelated sources.  
- Keep a log of failed lookups — it can indicate number spoofing or disposable use.  
- Consider time zone when contacting or investigating live leads.

---

## 🗂 9) Documentation Hygiene
- Record: full number in E.164 format, capture date (UTC), sources checked, matches found, and confidence rating.  
- Archive any related profile photos or linked account screenshots.
