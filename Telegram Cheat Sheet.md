# 🕵️‍♂️ Telegram OSINT Cheat Sheet

*Unlock intelligence on Telegram with speed and precision. This cheat sheet delivers actionable tips and tools for investigators to gather intel from Telegram profiles, phone numbers, emails, and groups—**while staying stealthy and legal.***  

## 👤 Username & Profile OSINT  
- 🔎 **Telegram Search** – Use Telegram’s built-in search with the `@username`. This direct approach finds the target’s profile or any mentions in public chats.  
- 🌐 **Cross-Platform Handle Hunt** – People often reuse usernames. Run the handle through search engines and username checkers (e.g. **Sherlock**, **Namechk**) to uncover profiles on other platforms. A simple Google dork like `site:t.me "username"` can reveal associated posts or channels.  
- 🖼️ **Profile Picture Recon** – Scrutinize the profile photo and bio. Extract the image and run a reverse image search (Google, Yandex) to find other accounts or sites where that picture appears. Bios might contain links or clues (like other social media handles or personal info) – note them for follow-up.  
- 📢 **Group & Channel Activity** – Check which public groups/channels the user is active in. Their messages or membership in open communities can expose interests, associates, or even personal details. Use Telegram directory sites or bots to see where a username pops up.  

## 📞 Phone Number Intel  
- 📱 **Contact Sync Trick** – Drop the target number into your contacts and let Telegram sync (use a clean “sockpuppet” account!). If their privacy settings are lax, you’ll see a profile name or username attached to that number. *This quick trick can confirm if a number is on Telegram.*  
- 🔍 **Open Web Lookup** – Search the phone number on Google (try variations with and without country code). Look for any public mentions – people often leave numbers in online ads, resumes, or social media posts. Even a partial hit can lead to name or address details.  
- 📞 **Reverse Number Tools** – Leverage free lookup tools to gather intel on the number: **Truecaller** or **Sync.Me** (crowdsourced caller ID) can yield a name or location; **PhoneInfoga** (open-source) can check for carrier and VOIP info. These tools help identify the person or at least the origin of the number.  
- 🗄️ **Breach Databases** – See if the number appears in any known data breaches or public dumps. HaveIBeenPwned (for some breaches) or specialized Telegram bots can check if the phone was in leaked records. Finding a number in a breach might also expose linked emails or usernames (gold for pivoting to other platforms).  
- 🤐 **Cross-App Check** – Without contacting the target, observe if that number is on other messaging apps (WhatsApp, Signal). Profile photos or statuses on those services (if visible) can give additional clues. **⚠️ OPSEC**: Do this with throwaway accounts to avoid exposing your identity or triggering read receipts.  

## ✉️ Email Discovery  
- 🔎 **Direct Email Search** – Plug the email address into Google (wrap it in quotes: `"target@example.com"`) to find any public mentions. People leave emails in forum posts, social profiles, or personal websites. Even obfuscated versions (like `user [at] example.com`) can show up in search results.  
- 📧 **Breach Check** – Use **HaveIBeenPwned** or similar services to see if the email appears in data breaches. While you won’t get passwords (and shouldn’t seek them), knowing which services were linked to that email (e.g. a LinkedIn breach hit) can hint where to look next.  
- 🕵️ **Username & Domain Pivot** – Extract the username from the email (the part before `@`) and the domain. The username might be a handle you can search on its own (did they use that name elsewhere?). The domain (if not common like Gmail) could be a workplace or organization – check the company site or LinkedIn for that domain to find your target’s identity.  
- 🌐 **Social Media Cross-Search** – Search the email on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, GitHub, etc. Many platforms have a “find by email” feature or people publicly list their email. For instance, developers often use their email on GitHub profiles or commits. A hit could directly link the email to a real name or profile.  
- 🛠️ **Email OSINT Tools** – Take advantage of free tools: **Hunter.io** can find emails by domain or validate an address; **Holehe** (OSINT tool) checks if an email is used to log into various sites. Even the password reset function on major sites can confirm if an account exists for that email (just be careful: *never attempt unauthorized access or alert the target*).  

## 🤖 Telegram Bots & Tools  
Sometimes the easiest way to gather Telegram intel is to use Telegram itself. Here are some handy (and **free or freemium**) bots and tools within Telegram for OSINT:  

| **Bot / Tool**              | **Purpose & Usage**                                            |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **SearcheeBot** 🤖          | Acts like a search engine for Telegram. Find public channels, groups, or posts by keyword. Great for discovering where a target might be mentioned or active. |
| **Username Checker Bot** 🕵️‍♀️ | Checks a given username across multiple platforms. It’s slow but thorough – a quick way to see if your target’s alias is used on Twitter, Instagram, etc., all from within Telegram. |
| **PhoneNFaceBot** 📱🎭       | Reverse-lookup for phone numbers *and* faces. Enter a phone number to get any linked names or emails (leverages public data). It even offers face recognition: upload a photo to find matching social media images. Limited free queries (then paid), but powerful for identity leads. |
| **OSINTExpertBot** 📂       | Searches leaked databases by email, username, or phone. Useful to quietly check if your target’s data was exposed in breaches. *Ethical warning:* This edges into gray territory – it automates querying breach data. Use responsibly and **never for malicious purposes**. |

*🔍 **Pro Tip:** Always verify info from bots with other sources. Bots can save time, but they might be outdated or have false hits. Treat their output as leads, not absolute truth.*  

## ⚠️ Common OPSEC Fails  
Even privacy-conscious Telegram users slip up. Exploit these common Operational Security fails (and **don’t make the same mistakes in your investigation**):  
- ⚠️ **Reused Aliases** – Targets often recycle the same username on Telegram and elsewhere. This lack of alias discipline creates an easy trail for you to follow across platforms. Always check for alias reuse – it’s low-hanging fruit.  
- ⚠️ **Public Info Leakage** – Many users leave personal info exposed. Examples: using a real photo or full name on their profile, or not hiding their phone number. Any tidbit left public is an OSINT gem. A profile picture might reveal their face (ripe for reverse search), and a visible phone number or link in bio is a direct pivot to more intel.  
- ⚠️ **Group Over-sharing** – In public groups, people forget they’re visible. They might mention workplaces, locations, or share contact info in chats. If your target is chatting openly in a large Telegram group, scan their messages for clues. Their guard is often down when they think they’re among friends or a niche community.  
- ⚠️ **Contact Linking** – Posting one’s **t.me** contact link or QR code on social media is an OPSEC fail that hands you their Telegram ID on a platter. It’s common: bloggers, sellers, and even activists share Telegram contact links. Those can reveal their username or phone (if not properly privacy-protected).  
- ⚠️ **Investigator Pitfall** – OPSEC fails aren’t just for targets! **Never use your personal Telegram** for investigations. Always create a burner account with a throwaway number. Otherwise, you risk exposing your identity or alerting the suspect. Similarly, avoid actions that leave footprints (viewing Stories with your name, accidentally calling the target, etc.).  

## ⚖️ Ethics & Legal Boundaries  
Operating in the shadows doesn’t mean operating outside the law or ethics. Keep these principles in mind:  
- 🛑 **Stay Within Legal Limits** – Only collect information that is *publicly available* or shared with you lawfully. Hacking accounts, coercing information, or accessing private data without consent isn’t OSINT – it’s illegal. Know the laws in your jurisdiction (data privacy, computer access, surveillance) and abide by them.  
- 🤝 **Consent & Privacy** – Respect privacy settings. If someone has locked down their info, don’t try to circumvent security or trick them into revealing it. OSINT means open-source – if you have to deceive or crack something to get data, you’ve crossed the line.  
- ⚖️ **Platform Terms** – Adhere to Telegram’s terms of service and policies of any tool you use. For example, scraping public data in bulk might violate terms even if the data is public. Getting banned or sued will quickly end your investigation. Use tools in moderation and according to their guidelines.  
- 📁 **Data Handling** – Treat the intel you gather with care. Don’t publicly expose personal information of innocent individuals. If you’re compiling a report, secure your files. Leaking sensitive data can have real-world consequences for you and others.  
- 🎯 **Purpose and Proportion** – Remember the mission. Collect only what you need for your investigative goal. Just because you *can* dig up info doesn’t mean you should record it. Every piece of data you collect is a responsibility. Keep your investigation focused and professional.  

## 🏆 Why Telegram is OSINT Gold  
Telegram combines the reach of a social network with the privacy of a messenger – a double-edged sword that heavily favors OSINT professionals:  
- 💬 **Vast Public Chats** – Unlike closed messaging apps, Telegram hosts countless public groups and channels. These are treasure troves of intel, from extremist group chats to local community boards. If it’s happening, there’s probably a Telegram channel about it – open for lurking.  
- 🕵️ **Alias Ecosystem** – Telegram users rely on aliases (@usernames) instead of sharing phone numbers. Those aliases are searchable and often reused elsewhere, giving you direct pivot points into other platforms. It’s a built-in handle system ready for exploitation.  
- 🌐 **Global and Uncensored** – Telegram’s lax moderation means information (and misinformation) flows freely. For OSINT, that means less content removed or hidden. You’ll find raw, unfiltered chatter and files on Telegram that would be banned on Twitter or Facebook. In investigative terms: more leads, less red tape.  
- 🔗 **Bridging Data Points** – Telegram accounts tie to phone numbers (for signup) *and* usernames. This dual identity means if you have one (say a username), you might snag the other through clever methods – linking an online persona to a real-world identifier. Few platforms offer this kind of two-way OSINT opportunity.  
- 🤖 **Bot-Friendly Platform** – Telegram’s API and bot ecosystem are wide open. Countless bots (as shown above) are available to automate searches and monitoring. You can even code your own with Python (using Telethon or similar libraries) to scrape messages or track user activity in channels. It’s an investigator’s playground with endless customization potential.  

**In short:** Telegram is an OSINT goldmine because it blends open community content with identifiable user data, all on a global scale. With the right techniques, a Telegram investigation can unearth connections that would stay hidden on other apps.
